Title: Semantics of a subset of the C language
Author: Eduardo Giménez and Emmanuel Ledinot 
Institution: Dassault-Aviation
Description: This contribution defines the denotational semantics of MiniC, a
sub-set of the C language. This sub-set is sufficiently large to
contain any program generated by lustre2C.
The denotation function describing the semantics of a MiniC program
actually provides an interpreter for the program.
